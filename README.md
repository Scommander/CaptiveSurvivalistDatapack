## Introduction

Captive Survivalist is an original minigame concept where you are put in a confined area each round and must outlive the other players as random events occur. This datapack is designed for Minecraft Java Edition 1.16+

## How to Use & Information

You need **at least** 2 players to play. A random event occurs at the beginning of each round. There are currently 10 unique events in the game which are covered below. But first how to use the datapack!

There are 2 commands you will need:
* “/trigger spread” - This will teleport you to a random location in the world so you can vary up where you play each round.
* “/trigger start” - This will teleport all players, create the world border and starts the round. When you win you gain a point which is displayed on the sidebar.

No "event" will be repeated until all events have been played.

See this IMGUR album for descriptions of each of the random events: https://imgur.com/gallery/h5oIAGE
